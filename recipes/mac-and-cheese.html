    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese <em>divided (measured after shredding)</em></li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese <em>divided (measured after shredding)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.</li>
            <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles.  Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand.</li>
            <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>n a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully.  Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown. </li>

        </ol>

    <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>To get the 4 cups of cheddar, use a 16 oz block of cheddar and shred. </li>
    <li>To get the 2 cups of gruyere, use as close to an 8 oz block of gruyere as you can (different brands have different sized blocks), and shred.</li>
    </ul>
