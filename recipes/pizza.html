    <h3>Truly italian pizza - O.G. style</h3>
        <p>Want to make <strong>real</strong> Italian pizza at home?</p>
        <p>Want to make the best homemade pizza crust and pizza sauce?</p>
        <p>Want to bake it just right on a blazing hot pizza stone?</p>
        <p>We’ll show you how to do it all. <em>Let’s make Italian pizza together!</em></p>
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li>1 ball pizza dough</li>
            <li>1/3 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Basil Pesto </li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the cheese: </strong>If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photo). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the pizza: </strong>When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. Stretch the dough into a circle. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven)</li>
            <li>Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
    

        </ol>

    <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
    <p>If you can, use <strong>great flour (Tipo 00)</strong>. The flour we use is called Tipo 00 flour; it’s what Neapolitan pizza restaurants use. It makes for a beautiful, supple and fluffy dough.</p>
