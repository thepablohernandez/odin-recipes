            <li>2 lb. ground beef (20% fat)</li>

        </ul>

    <h3 class="subpara">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over high. Cook 2 lb. ground beef, breaking up with a spoon, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6–8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and cook 2 medium onions, chopped, 2 small red bell peppers, seeded, chopped, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, stirring, until tender but not browned, 6–8 minutes</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°</li>
            <li>Let 3 packages Puff Pastry Dough for Empanadas sit at room temperature 15 minutes to temper. Remove 6 rounds from package, keeping plastic divider underneath, and arrange on a work surface. </li>
            <li>Place 2 Tbsp. filling in the center of each round.</li>
            <li>Top with 2 olive halves. Brush water around half of outer edge of each round. </li>
            <li>Using plastic divider to help you, fold round over filling and pinch edges to seal. </li>
            <li>Using a fork, crimp edges. Remove plastic and transfer empanada to a parchment-lined sheet tray, spacing 1" apart.</li>
            <li>Bake empanadas, rotating tray halfway through, until golden brown and slightly darker around the edges, 25–35 minutes</li>

        </ol>
